# CS3630-Perception-and-Robotics

Coursework for CS 3630: Introduction to Robotics

This repository includes implementations for robotics concepts. The portfolio takes us
on a journey from basic landmark perception using an SVM, path planning, Kalman Filtering,
and an end-to-end pipeline using all of these concepts.

The robot we used was an [Anki Cozmo](https://www.anki.com/en-us/cozmo).
